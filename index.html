  <h2>Sangeet Ceremony Invitation</h2>
  <h3>Hey everyone,</h3>
  <p>Guess what? Life's throwing me a curveball, and before I officially level up to the married club, I want to soak in one last awesome night with all of you while I'm still rocking the spinster title!</p>
  <p>I've been part of countless celebrations growing up, dreaming about the day when it'd be my turn. Well, that day is finally here! I'm thrilled to invite each and every one of you to my Sangeet ceremony. With the family getting bigger, your presence will make the night even more fantastic.</p>
  <p>On April 19 6:30 onwards at our Residency</p>
  <p>Can't wait for an evening filled with lights, music, and some killer dance moves!</p>
  <p>Cheers,<br>Shruti</p>
